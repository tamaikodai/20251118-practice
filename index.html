 <p>Life is the most precious thing. In the event of a disaster, remain calm and act without overexerting yourself. Never approach dangerous areas or take risky actions due to overconfidence. Your safety will give peace of mind to those around you. Make your own life your top priority, act quickly and appropriately, and evacuate to a safe place. Survival is the most important thing. Do not overexert yourself, protect your own safety, and cherish your life.</p>
